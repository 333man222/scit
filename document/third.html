    <h1>Someone like you</h1>
    <h2>Adele</h2>
    <p>
        I heard that you're settled down<br>
        That you found a girl and you're married now<br>
        I heard that your dreams came true<br>
        Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you<br>
        Old friend, why are you so shy?<br>
        Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light<br>
        I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
        But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
        I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
        And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over<br>
    </p>
